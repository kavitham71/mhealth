</p>
<p>
  <strong>DESCRIPTION:</strong>
  You are invited to participate in a research studyinvolving genetics and metabolic diseases. You will be asked to
  provide a blood and possibly a urine sample
  that can be banked and used in current and future genetic and metabolic research studies, many of which are not yet
  conceived. We will also collect your email address.
  Any future genetic study that is performed on your blood sample will undergo a scientific and ethical review prior to
  its start, but you will not necessarily be made
  personally aware of all the future research performed on your blood sample.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>PROCEDURES:</strong>
  With your permission, we would collect a sample of your or your childâ€™s blood and possibly urine. The blood draw
  (either venipuncture or heel stick for newborns)
  will coincide with a medically indicated blood draw, to avoid additional needle sticks. Adult participants are asked
  to provide ~ 30mls (or 2 tablespoons),
  children will provide less than 3mls/kg. Urine will be collected using a specimen container or a collection bag.
</p>
<p>
  <u>
    Tissue Sampling for Research
    <br/>
  </u>
  Research using tissues (including blood samples, and specifically DNA) is an important way to try to understand human
  disease. You have been given this
  information because the investigators want to include your tissues in a research project and because they want to save
  the samples for future research.
  There are several things you should know before allowing your tissues to be studied. <u></u>
</p>
<p>
  Your sample will be stored in a -80 freezer with a unique study ID instead of your name, and may be used either in a
  specific genetic research study now,
  saved for future undetermined research on a range of diseases, or both. Participation in this study or future research
  studies is entirely optional, and at
  any time you may withdraw your sample so that it is not used for any future research
</p>
<p>
  Any tissues you have donated which are used in research may result in new products, tests or discoveries. In some
  instances, these may have potential
  commercial value and may be developed and owned by the Investigators, Stanford University and/or others. Donors of
  tissues do not retain any property
  rights to the materials. Therefore, you would not share in any financial benefits from these products, tests or
  discoveries.
</p>
<p>
  <u>Tissue Sampling for Genetic Testing</u>
</p>
<p>
  Once you provide consent to participate in GenePool, a lab order is automatically placed in your medical record. You
  simply walk into any SHC blood draw area
  and a member of the SHC blood draw team will collect 3 tablespoons of blood from you. The blood draw order is active
  for 6 months, so you have the convenience
  of completing this part at a time that is more convenient for you. You may also submit a urine sample.
</p>
<p>
  As part of the analysis on your samples, the investigators will do a research based form of genetic testing. Genetic
  research studies genes and gene
  characteristics, many of which are transmitted by parents to children. This research may include looking at not only
  the genetic information in your tissue
  sample but also relating it to other information, such as your individual and family medical histories, prior test
  results in your medical record,
  reactions to medications and treatment, and other personal characteristics. Which of these are studied and the manner
  in which they are examined will vary
  depending on what research studies your sample is used in. After genetic testing is performed, is also possible that
  your genetic data will be put into a
  database held securely at Stanford, and which could be used to perform additional studies of the DNA data without
  requiring an additional blood sample from
  you. If this is done, your genetic data will be linked only to the unique study ID (and not your name or hospital
  medical record), and the data will be
  restricted to approved researchers and research projects within the university. Your data will be encrypted and sent
  to a secure database, with your name
  replaced by a random code.
</p>
<p>
  <u>Sharing of medical and genetic information and tissue samples</u>
</p>
<p>
  It is possible that we will enter into collaborative studies with other academic institutions or private entities that
  requires the sharing of your medical
  record information, genetic information, DNA samples, or other tissue samples. The medical record information will be
  stripped of all identifying
  information including your name and hospital number, and a unique study number provided instead. The code linking
  study number to your name and medical
  record number will remain confidential at Stanford. If federal grant funding will be employed for studies using your
  tissues, it may require that your
  genetic information (and that of every other study subject) will be deposited in a large database (for example, the
  database of genotypes and phenotypes,
  dbGAP) at the National Institutes of Health (NIH). Once your data is deposited into this database, we cannot withdraw
  your data, even if you withdraw from
  this study. However, access to these databases is highly restricted, with only qualified researchers gaining access to
  the data. If deposited into an NIH
  database, your data will become part of US government records and could be subject to requests under the Freedom of
  Information Act. NIH plans to contest
  any such requests for identifiable information, but their decision could be appealed. Although the NIH will not have
  any direct identifiers, it is
  conceivable that law enforcement agencies could request access to the de-identified data and search for matches to DNA
  specimens collected by the police.
  Again, there would be no information included in the NIH database that could be easily linked to your name or contact
  information, but all genome
  information should be considered potentially identifiable.
</p>
<p>
  [${participant.YesNIH} ] I <u>agree</u> have my data submitted to an NIH genetic database(s) if required.
</p>
<p>
  [${participant.NoNIH} ] I <u>do not agree</u> to have your data submitted to the NIH genetic database, and therefore
  decline participation using your
  sample in federally funded research projects.
</p>
<p>
  <u>Genetic testing results from the research studies</u>
</p>
<p>
  The results of the study of your samples will be used for research purposes only, and you will not generally be told
  the results of the genetic research
  that is performed using your sample. In some rare cases, the researchers will identify genetic information that may
  clearly impact your health or medical
  care, and where clinically-validated testing is available to confirm this finding, and the associated condition can be
  treated or medically managed. If
  this occurs, and if you indicate (below) that you wish to know this information, the protocol director will notify
  your treating physician. While this
  research data should not be used on its own to direct clinical care, you and your physician may then decide whether
  you wish to pursue clinically-validated
  testing. Regarding informing you of the any genetic research results, you should understand the following:
</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>
    Most genetic information that is obtained as part of genetic research is too limited to understand its consequences,
    and this is why results are not
    disclosed;
  </li>
  <li>
    There is a small chance that you may be determined to carry a gene that predicts high risk for a particular disease;
    some of these diseases can be
    treated, and for some there is no current treatment;
  </li>
  <li>
    If you learn that you carry a gene for a disease, other relatives might also carry the gene, and you should discuss
    with your treating physician the
    best way(s) to consider informing them.
  </li>
  <li>
    Possible risks of knowing genetic testing results include: anxiety; other psychological distress; and the
    possibility of insurance and job
    discrimination. A possible risk of not knowing actionable genetic test results includes being unaware of the need
    for surveillance or treatment. These
    risks differ for each specific disease.
  </li>
  <li>
    A Federal law, the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act of 2008 (GINA), generally makes it illegal for health
    insurance companies, group health
    plans, and employers with 15 or more employees to discriminate against you based on your knowledge of predictive
    genetic test results or family
    history. This law does not currently protect against discrimination for life insurance, long term care insurance or
    disability insurance.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Given the above considerations, please check [yes or no], below, as to whether you wish to be told in the rare event
  that the researchers identify results
  that may significantly impact your health or that of your family.
</p>
<p>
  [${participant.YesMedTreGenFin} ] I wish to be informed of medically treatable genetic findings (e.g. cancer, heart
  disease)
</p>
<p>
  [${participant.YesTreAndNonTreGenFin} ] I wish to be informed of genetic findings, including both treatable and
  non-treatable conditions
</p>
<p>
  [${participant.NoGenFin} ] I do not wish to be informed of any genetic research findings
</p>
<p>
  [${participant.YesRelGenFin} ] I only wish to be informed of genetic research findings that directly pertain to your
  personal or family history of: [${participant.FamilyHisOf}]
</p>

<!-- add Bio test-->
<p>
  <u>Biochemical (Metabolic) Tests</u>
</p>
<p>
  Your tissues may be used in research related to your metabolic status. While the results on the study of your sample
  will be used for research purposes, it is possible that some of the information gained by the researchers will have an
  impact on your health or medical care. Participantsalsohave the option to receive clinically significant biochemical
  test results from non-genetic tests assessing metabolic status. Some of these tests can include: plasma amino acids,
  urine organic acids and an acylcarnitine profile.
</p>
<p>
  [${participant.YesBioTest} ] I would like to receive clinically significant biochemical test results.
</p>
<p>
  [${participant.NoBioTest} ] I would not like to receive clinically significant biochemical test results.
</p>

<!-- add urine sample-->
<p>
  <u>Urine Sample</u>
</p>
<p>
  You also have the option to provide a urine sample in addition to a blood sample. A large range of metabolites are
  excreted through urine, thus urine samples provide an easy, non-invasive way to screen for potential disease
  biomarkers. A disease biomarker is a protein or small molecule that is useful for diagnosing, classifying or
  monitoring disease. The biomarkers found in urine complement those found in blood allowing researchers to have a more
  accurate representation of the disease state.
</p>
<p>
  [${participant.NoUrineSample} ] I would like to submit a blood sample only.
</p>
<p>
  [${participant.YesUrineSample} ] I would like to submit both blood and urine samples.

  <strong>CERTIFICATE OF CONFIDENTIALITY </strong>
</p>
<p>
  <strong> </strong>
</p>
<p>
  To help us protect your privacy, we have obtained a Certificate of Confidentiality from the National Institutes of
  Health. With this Certificate, the
  researchers cannot be forced to disclose information that may identify you, even by a court subpoena, in any federal,
  state, or local civil, criminal,
  administrative, legislative, or other proceedings. The researchers will use the Certificate to resist any demands for
  information that would identify you,
  except as explained below. The Certificate cannot be used to resist a demand for information from personnel of the
  United States Government that is used
  for auditing or evaluation of Federally funded projects or for information that must be disclosed in order to meet the
  requirements of the federal Food and
  Drug Administration (FDA). You should understand that a Certificate of Confidentiality does not prevent you or a
  member of your family from voluntarily
  releasing information about yourself or your involvement in this research. If an insurer, employer, or other person
  obtains your written consent to receive
  research information, then the researchers may not use the Certificate to withhold that information.<strong></strong>
