        <h2>STREAM: Studying TRiggers in Everyday Activity for Migraine</h2>
        <p><b>DESCRIPTION:</b> You are invited to participate in a research study, known as STREAM, designed to study trigger factors of episodic migraine headaches based on data that patients report in an iPhone app.  This study will also use Apple watches to gather information on physical activity and heart rate in order to explore potential associations between these factors and migraine headache.  The purpose of this study is to better understand the relationships between everyday activities and migraine headache occurrence and inform the care of patients with episodic migraine.</p>
        <p>About 300 participants will take part in this study.  If you agree to take part in this study, your involvement will last for 90 days.  This study is conducted via an iPhone app called STREAM, and a study-provided Apple watch that will be linked with your iPhone and the STREAM app.</p>
        
        
        <p><u>STREAM
            App component</u></p>
        
        <p><i>Day 1: </i> The app will ask you to do the following on the first day that you join the study:</p>
        
        <ol>
            
            <li>Respond to a set of baseline surveys about your health history, headache history, and trigger beliefs.  These surveys will take about 5 minutes each.</li>
            
            <li>Enable daily notifications and select the notification time of your choice to remind you to complete the end-of-day survey at a time close to your bedtime and before midnight.</li>
            
            <li>Enable sharing of the Health and activity data that is collected by your iPhone and Apple watch, and do not disable this sharing during the study.  This data sharing is necessary for the researchers to read the data collected by the Apple watch.</li>
            
            <li>Choose whether to enable sharing of the GPS location data that is already collected by your iPhone.  You may share this data either all the time, or only during the times that you are actually using the app to complete surveys, or never.  If you choose to share GPS location data, these will be used to associate local weather patterns with migraine headache incidence.  You will be able to change your location sharing settings at any time during the study, but previously shared location data will not be deleted.</li>
            
            <li>Complete an end-of-day survey about your sleep, diet, stress, and headache occurrence.</li>
        </ol>
        <p><i>Daily
            Tasks: </i>Each day for the next 90 days, the STREAM app will ask you to complete an end-of-day survey about your sleep, diet, stress, headache occurrence, and other symptoms. This survey is expected to take 2-4 minutes on each day of the study. Your completion of this survey each day is very important to the aims of the study. If you miss surveys repeatedly, then the research team will email and/or call you to check in.
        The research team will send you regular emails every 1-2 weeks about your survey completion and updates on the progress of the study.</p>
        
        <p><i>Apple
            Watch component: </i>:  The STREAM study will loan Apple watches to participants who do not already own Apple watches for the collection of physical activity and heart rate data for the duration of the study. After you finish the first two weeks of the study including on-time completion of the end-of-day survey on 12 of 14 days, then you will be mailed a loaner Apple watch to the address that you specify on registration. You will be asked to link this watch to your phone and wear the watch for as many of your waking hours as possible and charge it every night for the duration of the study. These Apple watches will need to be returned to the research team within 1 week of study completion using the pre-addressed and stamped packaging.
        </p>
        
        <p><i>Follow-up:
        </i>On the last day of the study, the STREAM app will ask you to complete a usability survey rating your experience using the app over the study period.  You may be selected to participate in a 15-minute follow-up phone interview about your experience using the app.  After study end, you will receive a personal summary of your trigger and headache data via email. </p>
        
        <p><b>TIME
            INVOLVEMENT/COSTS:</b>Your participation will take approximately 90 days.  Your participation will require 15-30 minutes to complete the baseline surveys in the STREAM app, 2-4 minutes daily responding to the end-of-day survey in the app for 90 days, and 10 minutes to complete the follow-up usability survey following the last day of the study.  You may also be selected to participate in a 15-minute follow-up phone interview following the last day of the study.
        </p>
        <p>You will not be
        charged for participation in this study. Data uploaded through the STREAM app
        may count against your mobile data plan, but you can set up the STREAM App to
        only use WiFi connections to limit impact on your data plan.</p>
        
        <p><b>RISKS AND
            BENEFITS:</b> The risks
        associated with this study are minimal in general. Inconveniences
        associated with participation include spending time outlined above in
        performing the surveys in the STREAM app and the associated study tasks.</p>
        
        <p><u>Risks
            related to privacy and confidentiality</u></p>
        
        <p>We
        treat any information we collect from you as strictly confidential. Your study
        data submitted through the STREAM app will be maintained on encrypted servers
        at Stanford. The risk of any information release is extremely low because Stanford
        and implements all of the data security and data storage requirements under
        HIPAA within the platform. Importantly, your personal identifiable information
        (e.g., name, phone number,
        and email and mailing addresses) will be stored
        separately from your study data and kept as confidential as possible. Your
        study data will be associated only with a randomized study code that bears no
        relation to any identifiable information. </p>
        
        <p>Whenever
        app data is transferred from the server to a research study computer, it will
        be encrypted so that others cannot interpret the data or associate it back to
        you. The study team will not have access to any personally identifying survey
        or device information. Your study data will be downloaded from the Stanford
        server to encrypted computers at Stanford University by registered study
        administrators via secure login with two-factor authentication and transmitted
        over https for security. Although Stanford maintains strict information
        technology procedures to safeguard participant information and to prevent
        improper access, it is possible that that there could be violations to the
        security of the computer systems used to store the codes linking your health
        information to you. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet, and
        no data storage facility, is 100% secure. While we strive to protect your
        information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of such information. This
        risk, while very low, should still be considered before enrolling.</p>
        
        <p>It
        is very important that you protect your iPhone with a passcode. One potential
        loss of privacy would be if someone sees the STREAM app icon and/or reminders
        on your phone and suspects that you have migraine headaches.</p>
        
        <p>The
        results of this research study may be presented at scientific or medical
        meetings or published in scientific journals. Your identity and/or your
        personal health information will not be disclosed except as authorized by you
        or as required by law. However, there is always some risk that even
        de-identified information might be re-identified. Your deidentified study
        data may be shared with third parties for the development of commercial
        products.</p>
        
        <p><u>Risks
            related to psychological distress</u></p>
        
        <p>Some
        of the questions in the surveys will ask about your thoughts, feelings, stress
        levels, and psychiatric conditions. These may briefly cause you distress.Â  In
        general, the questions will not be particularly intrusive or distressing, and
        stress will likely be transient. These questions have been previously
        validated and used in multiple studies and their responses are important to the
        goals of the study. </p>
        
        <p><u>Risks
            related to physical health</u></p>
        
        <p>Use
        of the mobile app and Apple watch do not endanger your physical health provided
        they are used on a context where you can safely focus on the app (e.g. not
        while driving or bicycling).</p>
        
        <p><u>Unknown
            risks</u></p>
        
        <p>There is
        always the possibility that research participation may bear some unknown or
        unforeseen hazards, discomforts or inconveniences. Please contact the study
        team if you feel you have experienced adverse outcomes from participation in
        this study. Significant new findings developed during the course of the
        research which may relate to your willingness to continue participation, will
        be provided to you in a timely manner. You will be told if any new information
        is learned that may affect your condition or influence your willingness to
        continue participation in this study.</p>
        
        <p><u>Potential
            Benefits</u></p>
        
        <p>We cannot guarantee that you will benefit from this study. However, a potential benefit is becoming more aware of your migraine headaches and potential trigger factors through completing the surveys for 90 days.  After you complete the study, you will receive a personal summary of your headache and trigger data, which might help you better understand your own migraine triggers and better communicate with your healthcare provider. In terms of benefits to others, the data that you contribute to this study will help researchers to build knowledge of the effect of various triggers on the incidence of migraine headache which will improve treatment of future migraine patients.
        Despite the possibility for personal benefit from study participation described above, it must be clearly stated that WE CANNOT AND DO NOT GUARANTEE OR PROMISE THAT YOU WILL RECEIVE ANY BENEFITS FROM THIS STUDY.
        </p>
        
        <p>HOW WILL MY
        DATA BE USED? After you complete the study and return the Apple watch, you will receive a personalized summary analysis of your trigger and headache data.  Your
        coded study data will be combined with data from other participants and used
        for research by the STREAM research team. To comply with legal and regulatory
        requirements, your deidentified study data may be made available to other
        researchers not affiliated with the study sponsor or the study team. </p>
        <p>Your
        deidentified study data may be shared with third parties for the development of
        commercial products.</p>
